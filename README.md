# Mesmer Fractal Skips Marker Pack

## **[Click here to download the pack!](https://github.com/Kaedalus/Mesmer-Fractal-Skips/releases/latest/download/MesmerFractalSkips.taco)**

Tried to be as detailed as possible, though some tricks might require previous knowledge from more detailed guides, such as [FeintFate's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZqZbggL_0o). If the "skips" are just portal placements, I also didn't include them, as this is extensively covered by other very common packs. :)

*Big thanks to xTeh, Saule and FeintFate for their guides!*

Made by Nickolas (Nick Kaedalus.9526). If you know of any other skips that aren't covered by this guide (or the disclaimers), feel free to hit me up in-game!
